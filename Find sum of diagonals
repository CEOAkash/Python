Find sum of diagonals
Given a matrix, find a sum of both diagonal elements of the matrix. 

 

Write a function solution that accepts a matrix A of size N x N as 2D list's elements. The function should return sum of both diagonal elements. 

 

Input 
    3 
    5 8 1 
    2 3 4 
    2 4 9 

 

    Where, 

First line of input represents the size of a matrix N. 
Second line contains list elements of 1st matrix row and so on. 
 

Output 
     20 

 

Here for the given matrix, 
5 3 8 and 1 3 2 are the diagonal elements. 

The sum of diagonal = 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 9 = 20

 

Note: Intersecting element of diagonals (here it's 3) will be included only once. 

 

Assume that, 

N is an integer within the range [1 to 1000].
