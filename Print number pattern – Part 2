Print number pattern â€“ Part 2
Given an integer N, print the following pattern. 

 

For input 5

        1
      2  3
    4   5   6
      2  3
        1

  

    Where,

First and the last row ends with 1. 
There must be single space between 2 numbers in the row. 
There should not be any space after the last number in the row. in the 3rd row, there should not be any space after number 6. 
 

Write a function: 
        void solution(int N) 

that accepts an integer N. A function should print pattern based on a value of N. 

 

Assume that, 

N is an odd integer within the range [1 to 50].
