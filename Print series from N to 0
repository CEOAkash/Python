Print series from N to 0
Given an integer N, print the sequence of integers from N to 0.

 
"""
Write a function solution that accepts an integer, and prints a sequence of integers from N up to 0 using do-while statement.

 

Input
    -8

 

Output
    -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0

 

    Where,

There must be a single space between consecutive numbers.
There should be no spaces after the last number.
