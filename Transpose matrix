Transpose matrix
Given a matrix, find the transpose of a matrix. 

 

Write a function solution that accepts a 2-Dimensional list. The function should return transposed matrix. 

 

Input
    2 
    4 
    1 2 3 4 
    2 9 -1 2

 

    Where, 

First line represents the number of rows of matrix as M. 
Second line represents the number of columns of a matrix as N. 
Third line represents list elements of 1st row and so on. 
 

Output
    1 2 
    2 9 
    3 -1 
    4 2
