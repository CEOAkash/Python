Count number of Squares
Given two integers A & B, count the number of square numbers between them (both inclusive). 

 

write a function: 
        public int solution(int A, int B)

that accept two integers A and B. The function should return a count of square numbers between A and B. 

 

Input 
    4 
    17 

 

    where, 

First line of represents integer A. 
Second line represents integer B. 
 

Output 
    3 

 

Between 4 and 17 there 3 squares numbers (4, 9 and 16). 

 

Assume that 

A and B are integers within the range [1 to 2,000,000,000]
